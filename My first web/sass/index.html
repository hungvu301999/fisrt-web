            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. These intelligent systems have the ability to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, perception, and problem-solving, that were once thought to be exclusively human.</p>
            <p>AI technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, leading to its widespread use in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. The development of AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, but it also raises important ethical and societal questions about the future of humanity and the role of technology in our lives.</p>
